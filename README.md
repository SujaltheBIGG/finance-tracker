## Backstory

The [Maybe Finance](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe) (archived/abandoned repo) team spent most of 2021–2022 building a full-featured personal finance and wealth management app. It even included an “Ask an Advisor” feature that connected users with a real CFP/CFA — all included with your subscription.

The business end of things didn't work out, and so they stopped developing the app in mid-2023.

After spending nearly $1 million on development (employees, contractors, data providers, infra, etc.), the team open-sourced the app. Their goal was to let users self-host it for free — and eventually launch a hosted version for a small fee.

They actually did launch that hosted version … briefly.

That also didn’t work out — at least not as a sustainable B2C business — so now here we are: hosting a community-maintained fork to keep the codebase alive and see where this can go next.

Join us!

## Hosting Founder Finance

Founder Finance is a fully working personal finance app that can be [self hosted with Docker](docs/hosting/docker.md).
Founder Finance can be accessed from a browser, the macOS desktop app, the mobile app, API
clients, and LLM agents. See [Founder Finance Clients](docs/clients.md) for an overview.

## Forking and Attribution

This repo is a community fork of the archived Maybe Finance repo.
You’re free to fork it under the AGPLv3 license — but we’d love it if you stuck around and contributed here instead.

To stay compliant and avoid trademark issues:

- Be sure to include the original [AGPLv3 license](https://github.com/maybe-finance/maybe/blob/main/LICENSE) and clearly state in your README that your fork is based on Maybe Finance but is **not affiliated with or endorsed by** Maybe Finance Inc.
- "Maybe" is a trademark of Maybe Finance Inc. and therefore, use of it is NOT allowed in forked repositories (or the logo)

## Performance Issues

With data-heavy apps, inevitably, there are performance issues. We've set up a public dashboard showing the problematic requests seen on the demo site, along with the stacktraces to help debug them.
